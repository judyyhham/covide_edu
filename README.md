# COVIED ("COVI-ED") 

COVIED is a COVID Educational website that is intended to teach students and educators of what Covid-19 was in a concise manner. This contains HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, API from World Health Education.

This project was submitted for Def Hacks 2020. 

## Inspiration
We wanted to make a website that informs about COVID-19, all in one place. Sometimes, it can be distracting and confusing with all the updates about new policies and regulations, research, and statistics. Therefore we wanted to create a concise and informative website, just about what the COVID-19 is. 

## What it does
The website consists of information about COVID-19, ways to prevent, quotations from experts, statistics about the current confirmed cases, informational video, and the symptoms of COVID-19.

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Challenges we ran into
Coming up with a project idea was a challenge for us. In the beginning, we were going to create an Android app that sends an alert when someone nearby does not follow the social distancing rule. However, a similar idea was already made by Google and Apple, therefore we had to quickly change our project idea.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to work together even though we had a difference in time zone (India and Canada). 

## What we learned
We learned all the different features and settings in HTML and CSS. 

## What's next for COVIED
The next steps for COVIED are cleaning up the UI/UX and adding additional information. We want to expand on this, therefore COVIED has some outstanding features that other websites do not have.
